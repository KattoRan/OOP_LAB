Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a
constructor method to build a DVD by category, does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: In this case, Java will not allow you to create the constructor method to build a
DVD by category if the constructor method to build a DVD by title is created.
• In Java, we have method overloading, which means many methods can have the
same name but different signatures (different parameters’ type and order). For
example:
public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
 this.title = title;
}
public DigitalVideoDisc(int category) {
 this.category = category;
}
=> Two methods which have the different signatures
• Two constructor methods must have the same name as DigitalVideoDisc.
However, both two parameters title and category are having the same data type
“String”. Therefore, these two methods will have the same signature. Java does
not allow you to create two methods having the same signature. 
public DigitalVideoDisc(String title) {
 this.title = title;
}
public DigitalVideoDisc(String category) {
 this.category = category;
} 
=>Two methos which have the same signature
